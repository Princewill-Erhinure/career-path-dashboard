## 🔍 Insights
This project helps understand:
-The Gender Gap in Data Roles
  Analysis revealed a significant gender gap in data-related roles globally,
  with women occupying only 25.71% of these positions compared to 74.29% held
  by men. This highlights ongoing gender imbalance in the field and underscores
  the need for more inclusive hiring practices.
- Breaking into Data:
  Most career switchers found the transition challenging —
  60% said it was “difficult” or “very difficult,” while only 30% found it easy.
  A large group (269) felt neutral, showing that the experience depends heavily
  on individual background and support.
- Global hotspots for data salaries
  While Africa has a large number of data professionals, salaries in the region remain the lowest globally 
  ranging between $20k to $75.5k. In contrast, roles in North America and Europe reach up to $225k.
  Despite growing demand, African professionals face a significant pay gap, highlighting global inequality in tech compensation.
